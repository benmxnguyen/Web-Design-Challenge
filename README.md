# Web-Design-Challenge

This assignment allowed me to demonstrate my knowledge of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 4. By leveraging all of these technologies, I was able to build a web page to present my findings on my analysis for latitude vs different weather aspects on a random sample of cities all over the world.

About the data: All of the data came from the OpenWeatherMap API, picking 500 random cities from randomly generated latitude and longitudes. The data that was looked at for these cities included latitude, longitude, cloudiness, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

I was able to publish my web pages through Github's server. Bootstrap allowed me to access a library of pre-written CSS that allowed me to beautify my web page through various components such as a navbar and gave easy access for responsive elements on the web page for different media queries.
